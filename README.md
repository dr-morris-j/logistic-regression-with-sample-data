# logistic regression and NBA data

The analysis aimed to find the key factors influencing an NBA team's success rate. 
The analysis emphasizes teams playing on their home courts.
Random forest analysis was inconclusive as there are many strongly correlated features.

Next steps:
Use a logistic regression model for deeper analysis.
Deploy and train the model. 
Determine model efficacy.

### About the model

The logistic regression model is written in Pytorch. 

The model is untrained, but the model training and deployment code is in place.
